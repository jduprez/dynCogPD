function [corr_tw,max_tw,ind_tw,cmat_allstr]=do_backfitting(opt,cmat_list,n_subs)

% This function assign the most similar spatial map among significant
% states (extracted at the group-level) to each of subject-level spatial
% maps and at each temporal window
%
% Inputs:
%   cmat_list : cell of length (nb_subs) containing the path of saved connectivity PLV
%   n_subs    : number of subjects
%   opt       : input structure with the following fields:
%               opt.threshnet_meth  : apply threshold on maps before similarity calculation (only 'no' option is implemented in the code
%               opt.corr_meth       : apply correlation as spatial similarity measure (only 'corr2' option is implemented in the code)
%               opt.cHC             : number of significant kept states in HC grp
%               opt.cPD             : number of significant kept states in PD grp
%               opt.states_maps_all : combined HC followed by PD significant maps, 3D matrix of dim [nROIs,nROIs,cHC+cPD];
%
% Outputs: 
%   corr_tw     : correlation values between spatial maps of each subject and at each temporal window with each of the significant maps states of both groups
%   max_tw      : the maximum correlation value among significant states (for each subject and at each temporal window)
%   ind_tw      : the index of significant state with the maximum correlation value (for each subject and at each temporal window)
%   cmat_allstr : output cell of length (n_subs) containing loaded cmat results for each subject
